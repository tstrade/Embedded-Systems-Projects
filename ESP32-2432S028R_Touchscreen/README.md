This project uses the ESP32-2432S028R Resistive Touchscreen 240x320 TFT LCD Module (Cheap Yellow Display) to recreate a classic iPod with a modern twist. 

The goal is to set up a Spotify-eqsue UI complete with playlists, shuffling, queues, and Bluetooth connection. The necessary mp3 files and corresponding metadata will be stored on a microSD card, 
ensuring that the device has plenty of storage for all my music!
